# Nutrition

As you continue to increase your running distances, especially with long runs like 24 km, proper nutrition becomes crucial for sustaining energy levels and optimizing performance. Here’s some guidance:

### **Before the Long Run**
1. **Carbohydrate Focused Meal** (2-3 hours before the run):
    - **Why**: Carbohydrates are your body's preferred fuel source during prolonged exercise. They provide the necessary glycogen stores in your muscles and liver.
    - **What to Eat**: A meal that’s rich in complex carbohydrates, moderate in protein, and low in fat and fiber to prevent digestive discomfort.
        - Examples:
            - Oatmeal with a banana and a small amount of honey.
            - Whole grain toast with peanut butter and a piece of fruit.
            - A smoothie with fruit, a handful of oats, and a scoop of protein powder (using water or almond milk to keep it light).
    - **Timing**: Eat this meal 2-3 hours before your run to allow time for digestion.

2. **Pre-Run Snack** (30-60 minutes before):
    - **Why**: Provides a quick source of energy to top off your glycogen stores without feeling too full.
    - **What to Eat**: Something light and easily digestible.
        - Examples:
            - A piece of fruit like a banana or apple.
            - A small energy bar or a handful of pretzels.
            - A clear protein shake like the one you mentioned, if that works well for you.

### **During the Long Run**
1. **Hydration and Electrolytes**:
    - **Why**: Staying hydrated and maintaining electrolyte balance is critical, especially for runs over 90 minutes.
    - **What to Drink**: Water with added electrolytes (like Hydraid) should be consumed regularly throughout the run.
        - **How Much**: Sip 150-250 ml every 20-30 minutes, adjusting based on the heat and humidity.

2. **Fueling**:
    - **Why**: After about 60-90 minutes of running, your glycogen stores will start to deplete, so consuming easily digestible carbohydrates can help maintain energy levels.
    - **What to Eat**: Gels, chews, or sports drinks are designed for this purpose and are easy to consume while running.
        - **How Much**: Typically, 30-60 grams of carbohydrates per hour after the first hour of running.
        - **Examples**:
            - Energy gels (like the one you used, which is mostly sugar).
            - Sports drinks that contain both carbohydrates and electrolytes.
            - Energy chews or small pieces of dried fruit like dates or raisins.

### **After the Long Run**
1. **Recovery Meal** (Within 30-60 minutes after the run):
    - **Why**: To replenish glycogen stores, repair muscle tissue, and rehydrate.
    - **What to Eat**: A meal with a good balance of carbohydrates and protein.
        - Examples:
            - A protein shake with fruit or a smoothie bowl.
            - A turkey sandwich on whole grain bread with some veggies.
            - Greek yogurt with granola and berries.

2. **Rehydration**:
    - **Why**: To replace fluids lost during the run and restore electrolyte balance.
    - **What to Drink**: Water, or an electrolyte drink if needed.

### **Additional Tips:**
- **Test Your Nutrition Strategy**: Like with your training, practice your nutrition strategy during long runs to see what works best for you. You don’t want to try anything new on race day.
- **Adjust for Weather**: In hotter or more humid conditions, you might need more electrolytes and fluids.

### **Balancing Weight Loss and Performance:**
- **Fuel for Performance**: As your training volume increases, it’s important to fuel your body adequately. Continuing a calorie deficit can lead to fatigue and impair recovery, so consider adjusting your intake slightly on days with long or intense runs.
- **Protein**: Keep up with your high protein intake to support muscle recovery, but ensure you’re not skimping on carbohydrates, as they are essential for endurance activities.

Your current approach with the clear protein shake and gel is on the right track, but incorporating more carbohydrates pre-run and adjusting your fueling strategy during the run will help you tackle those longer distances more effectively.
