# Running Plan

Given your current 10k time of 1 hour 18 minutes, aiming for a 1-hour finish by July 21st is an ambitious but achievable goal, especially with dedicated training. Here are some considerations and a structured training plan to help you reach your target:

### Evaluating Your Goal:
- **Current Pace:** Your current average pace is about 7:48 per kilometer.
- **Target Pace for 1 Hour:** To finish a 10k in 1 hour, you need an average pace of 6 minutes per kilometer.
- **Target Pace for 1 Hour 10 Minutes:** This requires an average pace of 7 minutes per kilometer.

Reducing your time by 18 minutes over approximately 2 months will require consistent and varied training, focusing on building speed, endurance, and overall fitness.

### Additional Tips:

3. **Sleep and Recovery:** Ensure you get adequate sleep and recovery time to allow your muscles to repair and strengthen.
