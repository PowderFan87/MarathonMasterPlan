# Marathon Master Plan

### Marathon Training Plan Outline

The training plan will be structured into phases, each focusing on different aspects of training to ensure a balanced approach:

1. **Base Building Phase (Weeks 1-4)**
2. **Endurance Building Phase (Weeks 5-8)**
3. **Peak Training Phase (Weeks 9-12)**
4. **Tapering Phase (Weeks 13-16)**

### Detailed Training Plan for the First Four Weeks

Here is a detailed training plan for the first four weeks, focusing on building your base mileage and preparing your body for the increased demands of marathon training:

* [](Week-1.md)
* [](Week-2.md)
* [](Week-3.md)
* [](Week-4.md)

### Explanation and Adjustments

1. **Easy Runs:** These runs are designed to help with recovery, build a base, and keep your legs moving without too much stress.
2. **Tempo Runs:** Tempo runs help improve your lactate threshold, making it easier to maintain a faster pace over longer distances.
3. **Interval Training:** Intervals improve your speed and cardiovascular fitness. We'll continue working on pacing to ensure you're comfortable with various speeds.
4. **Long Runs:** These are crucial for building the endurance necessary for the marathon. We gradually increase the distance to prepare you for the full marathon distance.

### Key Focus Areas

- **Consistency:** Stick to the plan and gradually build your mileage and intensity to avoid injury.
- **Recovery:** Pay attention to rest and recovery, especially if you feel any discomfort in your Achilles.
- **Pacing:** Practice maintaining your goal marathon pace during your long runs.
- **Hydration and Nutrition:** Start experimenting with hydration and nutrition strategies during long runs to find what works best for you.

### Next Steps

1. **Follow the Plan:** Stick to the detailed plan for the first four weeks.
2. **Provide Updates:** Share your run data using the JSON template at the end of each week.
3. **Adjust as Needed:** Based on your feedback and performance, we can adjust the plan as we progress.
