### Observations
1. **Tempo Run:** Your tempo run was quite intense, with a significant amount of time in high heart rate zones (Zone 4 and 5). This indicates a strong effort and good pace improvement.
2. **Interval Training:** The intervals were very tough, which is reflected in your heart rate and the fact that you couldn't complete all planned intervals. This suggests that the initial interval distance might have been too ambitious.
3. **Easy Run:** Your easy run was well within the expected heart rate zone, providing good recovery.
4. **Long Run:** Your long run was also intense, with a high percentage of time spent in Zone 4 and 5, indicating a strong endurance effort.

### Adjustments for Week 3
To ensure balanced training and recovery, we'll adjust the interval training to make it more manageable and maintain the current structure for other workouts.

### Week 3 Plan:
**Monday:** Tempo Run
- **Workout:** 6-8k at 7:00-7:15/km pace. Try to keep the pace steady and manage heart rate to stay mostly in Zone 3 and lower Zone 4.

**Tuesday:** Interval Training
- **Workout:** 6x400m at 5:30-5:40/km pace with 2 minutes rest. Since 800m intervals were too challenging, we'll scale back to 400m to build confidence and manageability.

**Wednesday:** Rest or cross-training
- **Workout:** Light activity such as swimming, cycling, or yoga.

**Thursday:** Rest or light cross-training
- **Due to appointments, keep this day low intensity.

**Friday:** Easy Run
- **Workout:** 6-7k at a comfortable pace (8:30-9:00/km). Focus on staying in Zone 2 for recovery.

**Saturday:** Long Run
- **Workout:** 12-14k at 7:00-7:15/km pace. Aim to keep a steady pace and try to manage heart rate to stay in Zone 3 and lower Zone 4.

**Sunday:** Recovery Run or cross-training
- **Workout:** Easy 3-5k run or light activity such as swimming or cycling.

### Additional Tips
1. **Pacing:** During your tempo and long runs, focus on finding a sustainable pace that allows you to stay mostly in Zone 3 and lower Zone 4. This will help build aerobic endurance without overtaxing your system.
2. **Hydration and Nutrition:** Continue to pay attention to pre-run and post-run nutrition to support recovery and performance.
3. **Recovery:** Incorporate stretching, foam rolling, and adequate sleep to aid recovery. Listen to your body, and adjust the intensity if you feel overly fatigued.

By following this adjusted plan, you should be able to build on your Week 2 progress while ensuring adequate recovery and sustainable improvements. Keep up the great work, and let's aim for more balanced intensity levels in Week 3!
