I tried your nutrition advice for breakfast before the long run that made a difference I think. Just arround 23km my heartrate was going up all of a sudden arround 167 which apparently is my lactiv accid threshhold and I couldn't keep it down any more. But up until then the run was very comftable. And again a new PB for half marathon with 2:15:55."
